## Dapp Models

### what problems Dapps can solve? 
- We can find many current examples for Ethereum-based Dapps in this www.stateofthedapps.com

- Bitcoin code-base is open source 
- the initial response to Bitcoin from the developer community, were the releases of many new crypto currencies. 
- Then came the innovation of Ethereum Smart Contract. 
	- It helped automate the crowd funding for startups using a virtual instrument called Koine and the process of initial coin offering. 
	- This is similar to an initial public offering IPO of company stocks. 
	- Coin ICO use a block chain to record the distribution of the coin, receive funds, specified rules,  and to enforce any preconditions and policies
- Zcash focuses heavily on privacy and uses closed-code? 
- We classify any cryptocurrency that raise fronts through ICOs in the coins Dapps. 
- Both Ethereum and Zcash used ICO processes for that initial funding

### Tokens:
- tokens and coins are used synonymously. 
- However, Token is like a Dapp coin but, its offering is typically associated with an asset or utility. 
- For example, in the highly popular cryptoKitties, a token is used to represent the kitty or all the rules for the creation lifecycle, breeding etc are written into the immutable Ethereum block chains Smart Contract. 
- At pre-determined times, a certain number of new tokens are released and auctioned off for raising new funds. 
- Assets are Kittys in this case, also appreciate or depreciate in price based on the demand. 
- So the tokens are non-fungible.

- Auger is a prediction Dapp that depends on the wisdom of crowd and their reports on reputation of a product to predict markets. 
- These decentralized participants or crowd get paid in REP tokens or reputation tokens. 
- These tokens represent a fraction of the fees collected if the transaction gets executed, based on the crowds reporting. 

### DAO
- Decentralized Autonomous Organization is an early innovation in Dapp. 
- DAO was an investment instrument deployed as a smart contract on Ethereum block chain, Autonomous venture capital Dapp to be exact. 
- The idea was to showcase an autonomous organization without traditional corporate governance structure for a decentralized anonymous Fund-Raising, and automatic investing. 

### Decentralized marketplace:
- It could be Dapp for anything from selling goods to education credentialing. 
- a marketplace facilitates meetings of sellers and buyers. 
- You can build a marketplace platform where decentralized buyers and sellers, those unknown to one another, can meet and exchange items with the payment and transaction recorded on any of the established blockchain 
- technologies such as Bitcoin or Ethereum. 
- You can always use Bitcoin as a payment system for the global marketplace you build.
- Is there a smart contract code for supporting buying or selling?  - Yes, there is. 
	- An example is safe remote purchase smart contract in purchase.sol in the solidity documentation
