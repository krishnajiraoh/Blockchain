# Beyond Bitcoin

### Smart Contracts:

- Bitcoin supports an optional and special feature called scripts for conditional transfer of values. 
- Ethereum Blockchain extended the scripting feature into a full-blown code execution framework called smart contract. 
- A smart contract provide the very powerful capability of code execution for embedding business logic on the blockchain. 

#### Based on such capabilities, three major types of blockchains emerge from Bitcoin foundation.

- Type one deals with the coins in cryptocurrency currency chain. Example, Bitcoin. 
- Type two supports cryptocurrency and a business logic layer supported by code execution. Example, Ethereum. 
- Type three involves no currency but supports software execution for business logic. Example, The Linux Foundation's Hyperledger


### Categories:

- Public, ex Bitcoin
	○ Developers restriction, 
- Private:
	○ Less chance of an attack, cheaper transactions, trusted, privacy, alter rules as needed
- Permissioned
	○ meant for a consortium of collaborating parties to transact on a blockchain for ease of governance, provenance, and accountability for example, 
	○ Ex: a consortium of all automobile companies or healthcare organizations. 
	
	
	
### What’s the difference between a blockchain a a normal database?:

- Very loosely, a blockchain system is a package which contains a normal database plus some software that adds new rows, validates that new rows conform to pre-agreed rules, and listens and broadcasts new rows to its peers across a network, ensuring that all peers have the same data in their databases.
