### Address:

	• Address is a special Solidity define composite data type. 
	• It can hold a 20-byte ethereum address. 
	• Recall address is a reference address to access a smart contract. 
	• Address data structure also contains the balance of the account in Wei. 
	• It also supports a function to transfer a value to a specific address


### Mapping:
	• Mapping is a very versatile data structure that is similar to a key value store, 
	• it also can be thought of as a hash table. 
	• The key is typically a secure hash of a simple Solidity data type such as address and the value in key-value pair can be any arbitrary type.


### Message:
	• Message is a complex data type specific to smart contract. 
	• It represents the call that can be used to invoke a function of a smart contract.
	• Sender, value, etc
