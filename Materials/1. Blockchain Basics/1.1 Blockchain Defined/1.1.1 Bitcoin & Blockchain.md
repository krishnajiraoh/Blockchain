# Bitcoin & Blockchain

### Applications of Blockchain:
The blockchain is poised to innovate and transform a wide range of applications, 
Including: 

- goods transfer, for example, supply chain. 
- Digital media transfer, for example, sale of art. 
- Remote services delivery, example, travel and tourism. 
- Platform for decentralized business logic, for example, moving computing to data sources. 
- distributed intelligence, example, education credentialing. 

#### Additional applications of blockchain include:

- distributed resources, for example, power generation and distribution. 
- Crowd funding for example, startup fund raising. 
- Crowd operations, for example, electronic voting. 
- Identity management, for example, one ID for all your life's functions. 
- And government public records and open governing


### Major contributions of Bitcoin:

- continuously working digital currency system, and 
- a model for autonomous decentralized application technology called the blockchain.

Bitcoin enabled an innovative platform for peer to peer transfer of value without any central authority.
By implementing software programs for validation, verification, consensus in a novel infrastructure called the blockchain


### What is blockchain:

Blockchain is a decentralized database that stores registry of assets and tx across a peer to peer network. It is a public registry who owns what and who txs what

Blockchain is about enabling peer to peer transaction in a decentralized network. 
Establishing trust among unknown peers. 
Recording the transaction in an immutable distributed ledger.

Blockchain technology supports methods for a decentralized peer-to-peer system, a collective trust model, and a distributed immutable ledger of records of transactions.
