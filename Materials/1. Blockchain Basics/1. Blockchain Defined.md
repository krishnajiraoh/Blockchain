# Bitcoin & Blockchain

## Applications of Blockchain:
The blockchain is poised to innovate and transform a wide range of applications, 
Including: 

	• goods transfer, for example, supply chain. 
	• Digital media transfer, for example, sale of art. 
	• Remote services delivery, example, travel and tourism. 
	• Platform for decentralized business logic, for example, moving computing to data sources. 
	• distributed intelligence, example, education credentialing. 

### Additional applications of blockchain include:

	• distributed resources, for example, power generation and distribution. 
	• Crowd funding for example, startup fund raising. 
	• Crowd operations, for example, electronic voting. 
	• Identity management, for example, one ID for all your life's functions. 
	• And government public records and open governing


## Major contributions of Bitcoin:

	• continuously working digital currency system, and 
	• a model for autonomous decentralized application technology called the blockchain.

Bitcoin enabled an innovative platform for peer to peer transfer of value without any central authority.
By implementing software programs for validation, verification, consensus in a novel infrastructure called the blockchain


## What is blockchain:

	Blockchain is a decentralized database that stores registry of assets and tx across a peer to peer network. It is a public registry who owns what and who txs what

	Blockchain is about enabling peer to peer transaction in a decentralized network. 
	Establishing trust among unknown peers. 
	Recording the transaction in an immutable distributed ledger.

	Blockchain technology supports methods for a decentralized peer-to-peer system, a collective trust model, and a distributed immutable ledger of records of transactions.

## Blockchain Structure:

	• Transactions form basic element of the bitcoin blockchain
	• Transactions are validated and broadcast. 
	• Many transactions form a block. 
	• Many box form a chain through a digital data link. 
	• Blocks go through a consensus process, to select the next block that will be added to the chain. 
	• Chosen block is verified, and added to the current chain. 
	• Validation and consensus process are carried out by special peer nodes called miners.


## UTXO:

	• A fundamental concept of a bitcoin network is an Unspent Transaction Output, also known as UTXO. 
	• The set of all UTXOs in a bitcoin network collectively define the state of the Bitcoin Blockchain. 
	• UTXO's are referenced as inputs in a transaction. 
	• UTXO's are also outputs generated by a transaction. 
	• Now let's review the role of the UTXO's in a Bitcoin Blockchain. 
	• The transaction uses the amount specified by one or more UTXOs and transmits it to one or more newly created output UTXOs, according to the request initiated by the sender. 

## The structure of a given UTXO is very simple:

	• It includes a unique identifier of the transaction that created this UTXO, 
	• an index or the position of the UTXO in the transaction output list, 
	• a value or the amount it is good for. 
	• And an optional script, the condition under which the output can be spent. 


## More on UTXO: Unspent Transaction Output, UTXO
### BTC:

	• The sum of these outputs is the user’s total balance. 
	• On the blockchain, they appear to be a collection of Bitcoin amounts on different addresses and the role of a wallet is to identify which addresses the user has keys to. 
	• Individual Bitcoin are easy to track because they are signed from one person to another. 
	• A transaction is valid if one can prove ownership over the actual Bitcoin s/he is trying to send.

### ETH:

	• This is in contrast to ethereum's account model, which stores information about the entire balance associated with a user’s account. 
	• Other users send tokens to and from their own accounts. 
	• Individual ETH are more difficult to track because they are added and subtracted to user balances. 
	• A transaction is valid if one can prove ownership over the account and the account’s balance is high enough to support it.

# Basic Operations

## List of operations:

	• validation of transactions, 
	• gathering the transactions for a block, 
	• broadcasting the valid transactions & blocks, 
	• consensus on the next block creation, 
	• chaining the blocks to form an immutable record.



## Two types of Participants:

	• Participants that initiate transfer of value by creating a transaction, 
	• additional participants called miners, who pick on added work or computation to verify transactions, broadcast transaction, compete to claim the right to create a block, work on reaching consensus by validating the block, broadcasting the newly created block, and confirming transactions. 


## Miners:

	The miners are incentivised with bitcoins for the efforts in managing the blockchain, 
	Transaction validation is carried out independently by all miners. 
	The process involves validation of more than 20 criteria, including size, syntax, et cetera. 
	Some of these criteria are: Referenced Input Unspent Transaction Output, UTXOs are valid, reference output UTXOs are correct, reference input amount and output amount matched sufficiently, invalid transactions are rejected and will not be broadcast. 
	All the valid transactions are added to a pool of transactions. 
	Miners select a set of transaction from this pool to create a block. 

## PoW:

	Miners compete to solving a puzzle to determine who earn the right to create the next block. 
	In the case of bitcoin blockchain, this puzzle is a computational puzzle and the central processing unit or CPU intensive. 
	Once a miner solves the puzzle, the announcement is broadcast to the network and the block is also broadcast to the network. 
	Then, other participant verify the new block. 
	Participants reach a consensus to add a new block to the chain. 
	This new block is added to their local copy of the blockchain. 
	Thus, a new set of transactions are recorded and confirmed. 
	The algorithm for consensus is called proof-of -work protocol, since it involves work a computational power to solve the puzzle and to claim the right to form the next block. 

## Block Reward:

	Transaction zero, index zero of the confirmed block is created by the miner of the block. 
	It has a special UTXO and does not have any input UTXO. 
	It is called the coinbase transaction that generates a minor's fees for the block creation. 
	Currently, the minor's fees is 12.5 BTC for a bitcoin.
