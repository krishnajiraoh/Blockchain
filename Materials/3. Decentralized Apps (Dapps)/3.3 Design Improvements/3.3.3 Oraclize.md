## Oraclize

### Why can't a smart contract access outside sources?
- Depending on the source code, it may affect the global consistency of the blockchain.
- The results of an operation on the blockchain has to be deterministic.
- These conditions limit the applicability of the smart contracts in many real world applications that may involve obtaining facts, data, and assets from external world sources. 
- Moreover, the data has to be obtained at the time of execution and may not be available at the time of deployment of the contract.

### Oraclize :
- Oraclize is described as a data carrier between the web resources, APIs and the URLs, and the smart contract.
- Of course, Oraclize is outside the blockchain protocol.
- However, it is a useful component of Dapps that facilitate the availability of real world facts needed for the functioning of certain smart contracts.

- UsingOraclize is a smart contract that provides minimally a query function to access external sources. 
- It not only fetches the data, but it also provides proofs and authentication about the sources if needed by calling the smart contract.
- The data requested is returned through a callback function since accessing the data and verification may take some time. We do not want the blockchain smart contract waiting on results
