# Fabric Services

- According to the whitepaper, the design of Hyperledger places heavy emphasis on modularity and configurability, pluggable modules. 
- A Hyperledger blockchain application views its domain as being made up of many interacting blockchains of various capacities.

### The reference architecture specifies four different groups of services and the corresponding APIs for the applications to access them:
- Identity services,
	- manages the identities of entities, participants, ledger objects, such as smart contract.
- Policy services,
	- manages access control, privacy detail, consortium rules and consensus rules.
- Blockchain services
	- manages the peer-to-peer communication protocol, the distributed ledger maintaining the global state, the global state replicated at many participants, 
	- the plugable consensus algorithm, PBFT or POW. 
- Smart contract services.
	- provide a secure and lightweight sandbox environment for the chain code to execute.
	- Only full nodes call the validating nodes include the smart contract services.
	- Java virtual machine that runs bytecode typically serves as a computational environment for the smart contract execution
