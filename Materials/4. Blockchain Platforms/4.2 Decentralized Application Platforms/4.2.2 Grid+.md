## Grid+

### Distributed energy resources or DERs
- how many times have you seen a solar panel installation on a personal dwelling, a windmill on a country farm
- How do they manage the diverse demand at the user level, to the decentralized production enabled by the abundance of DERs

### Grid+
- an accounting layer or Dapp platform for the energy ecosystems on the smart contracts layer
- four phases of the energy supply chain: production,  transmission, distribution, and retail. 
- Grid+ focuses on innovating the energy retail sector with the integration of the blockchain technology. 
- There are opportunities for modernization, improving efficiency, updating payment system, and cost cutting for the end-user. 
- Field experts suggest that about 50 percent of the end-user energy cost is not for electricity but for the administrative warheads. 
- Grid+ aims to minimize this with better technology and make electricity grid cost effective, reliable, and robust
####
- Grid+ aims to move energy transfer and payment transaction onto the emerging blockchain architecture. 
- Grid+ pushes market signals to the end-users who can retain control of their energy assets and make smart decisions. 
- This improves energy usage efficiency and also reduces costs to the end-user. 
- Grid+ provides a seamless payment system, leveraging crypto tokens, thus improving efficiency in the energy payments system
####
- In a deregulated electricity market, market participants other than the utility companies own power plants and transmission lines. 
- In such contexts, the companies that generate electricity, sell electricity into a wholesale market, and the retail energy suppliers purchase this electricity to sell it to the customers. 
- This deregulated electricity market offers an opportunity for Grid+ to test its operational capacity and commercial viability
- A Grid+ Smart Agent is a computing device that hosts a software for blockchain transaction, multi-signature crypto wallet with PKI security, and off chain payments for faster confirmations.
