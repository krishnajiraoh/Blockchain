	• EVM provides execution environment for a smart contract bytecode. 
	• The smart contract requires an address for itself so that transaction can target it for invocation of its function. 
	• The contract address is generated by hashing the sender's account address and its nonce. 
	• A unique target account is reserved for smart contract creation and deployment. 
		○ Target account zero. 
		○ If a target's address is zero or null, it is meant for creating a new smart contract using its payload feed. 
		○ The payload of a transaction contains the bytecode for the smart contract. 
		○ This code is executed as a part of  the transaction execution to instantiate the bytecode for the actual smart contract. 
		○ Similar to how a constructor creates an object, the execution of a smart contract creation transaction results in the deployment of this smart contract code on the EVM. 
		○ It is permanently stored in the EVM for future invocation. 
	• This transaction goes through all the regular verification and validation specified in the ethereum blockchain protocol. 
	• Block creation, transaction confirmation by the full nodes deploys a the same contract on all the nodes. 
	• This provides consistent execution when the regular transaction with function messages are invoked on the smart contract.
