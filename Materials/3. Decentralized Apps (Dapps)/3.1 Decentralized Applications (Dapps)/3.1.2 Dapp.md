### Dapp:

- A Dapp, or decentralized application, solves a problem that requires blockchain services and blockchain infrastructure for realizing its purpose.
- Typically, a Dapp has a web front-end, and a blockchain back end, and the code connecting the two.

- In such an architecture, the front-end of a Dapp channels any external stimulus from the users to the blockchain infrastructure and returns any response back to them.
- It initiates transactions to invoke functions on the smart contract. 
- That in turn, records the transactions and state transition and receipts on the blockchain. 
- The front-end of a Dapp can be as simple as a command line interface.

- It can also be a sophisticated web app or an easy to use mobile app. 
- The front-end development may involve development of a web client with the HTML, JavaScript, and CSS's, and other web assets, or a web app framework, such as Express. 
- Here, the blockchain server is the enode on the underlying infrastructure. 
- And the front-end is a web client with embedded web3.js script, communicating using JSON over RPC pipeline.
