# Consensus Protocol

### PoW:
- A secure chain is a single main chain with a consistent state. 
- compute the hash of the block header elements that is a fixed value, and a nonce that is a variable. 
- If hash value is less than 2 par 128 for bitcoin, and less than function of difficulty for ethereum, the puzzle has been solved. 
- If it has not been solved, repeat the process after changing the nonce value. 
- If the puzzle has been solved, broadcast the winning block that will be verified by other miners. 
- Non-winning miner nodes add the new block to the local copy of the chain, and move on to working on the next block. 
- The winner gets an incentive for creating the block.
