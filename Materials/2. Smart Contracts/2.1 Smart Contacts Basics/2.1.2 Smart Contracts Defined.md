	• Smart contract work with the application-specific semantics and constraints of the transaction and verify,  validates, and executes them. 
	• Most of all, since it is deployed on the blockchain, the smart contract leverages the immutable recording and trust model of the blockchain. 
	• Since a smart contract is deployed in the blockchain, it is an immutable piece of code, and once deployed, it cannot be changed. 
	• We will have to redeploy the code as a new smart contract, or somehow redirect the calls from a old contract to the new one. 
	• Smart contract can store variables in it called state variables. 
	• We could retrieve how these variables change over the blocks. 
	• Contract in the Ethereum blockchain has pragma directive, name of the contract, data or the state variable that define the state of the contract, collection of function to carry out the intent of a smart contract. 
	• Other items, we'll discuss in the later lessons. 
	• Identifiers representing these elements are restricted to ASCII character set.
