## Why Smart Contracts

### Smart contract is a centrepiece and main thrust of Ethereum blockchain
- It is the good, bad and the ugly of the blockchain technology. 
- It's a powerful feature. 
- Improper design and coding of a smart contract, can result in significant failures such as DAO hack and Parity wallet lockup

### Bitcoin & Smart Contract:
- Bitcoin has a script feature that includes rules and policies. 
- Bitcoin added a simple conditional transfer of value through an embedded script.
- The script was limited in its capabilities.  It enabled simple conditional transfers.
- Linux Foundation's Hyperledger blockchain has a smart contract feature called Chaincode. 

### Ethereum & Smart Contract:
- The concept of the smart contract was there well before the advent of the Bitcoin. 
- Computer scientist Nick Szabo detailed his idea of cryptocurrency Bit gold as a sort of a precursor for Bitcoin. 
- The founders of Ethereum developed smart contract keeping Nick Szabo's idea of a smart contract from over 20 years ago in mind. 
- A significant contribution of Ethereum is a working smart contract layer that supports any arbitrary code execution over the blockchain. 
- Smart contract allows for user-defined operations of arbitrary complexity. 
- This feature enhances the capability of Ethereum blockchain to be a powerful decentralized computing system.


### Why Smart Contract?
- Cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, enable transfer of values such as money or currency from peer-to-peer without any intermediaries. 
- For what? To gift somebody, to buy a product,  maybe even renew a driver's license, etc
- We may want the gift to be delivered on a certain date, buy a product of a particular color and quality, we may need some credentials verified for renewing the license. 
- This introduces conditions, rules, policies beyond that of which a simple money transfer cryptocurrency protocols can handle.

### Let us compare Bitcoin transaction and a smart contract transaction: 
- All the transactions are about send value. 
- In the case of a blockchain that supports a smart contract, a transaction could embed a function implemented by a smart contract. 
- Ex:  a voting smart contract. 
- The functions are ValidateVoter, Vote, Count, Declare Winner. 
- Smart contract provides a layer of computation logic that can be executed on the blockchain, thus availing the features enabled by the blockchain framework.

- Typically, currency transfer is used to buy a service, a product, or a utility from a person or a business. 
- There may be other conditions besides availability of funds while executing a transaction. 
- For example, a business transaction may involve rules, policies, laws, regulations and governing contexts. 
- Smart contract allows for these other real world constraints to be realized on a blockchain, 
- thus a smart contract enables a wide variety of decentralized application of arbitrary complexity to be implemented on the blockchain. 
- This can run the spectrum from supply chains to disaster recovery.
