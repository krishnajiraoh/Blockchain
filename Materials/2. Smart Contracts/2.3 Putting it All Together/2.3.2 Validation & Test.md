	- In the ballot example, Validation of time and stage are done inside the function code, programmatically. 
	- Because of this, the transaction is executed and recorded on the block chain, irrespective of whether the validation fails or succeeds. 
	- is there any way to reject the transaction? 
		○ In a way similar to how transactions were rejected, at the block chain protocol level, 
		○ if they don't conform to the rules, that is, if the problem specific conditions are not met toward the transaction. 
		○ In this case, the transaction will not be recorded on the block chain, wasting effort and space. 
	- If there is a way to separate the validation from the actual code that the function executes, 
	- is there a way to specify the problem specific rules and condition declaratively,
		○  so that they can be independently specified, as well as audited to assure that the smart contract does what it's supposed to do? 
		○ Auditing of the Smart Contract is specially critical, since a smart contract is expected to be autonomous and permanent, once deployed




Use modifiers to specify conditions to be executed outside the chain
