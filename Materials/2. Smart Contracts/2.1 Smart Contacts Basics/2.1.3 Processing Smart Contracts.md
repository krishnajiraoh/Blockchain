### Address of a smart contract:
	- We need an address for the smart contract to deploy it and invoke its functions. 
	- The address is computed by hashing the account number of externally owned account UI and the nonce.

### ABI, Application Binary Interface, 
	- the interface schema for a transaction to invoke functions on the smart contract instance bytecode. 
	- details functions, parameters and return values,

###Contract Bytecode:
	• this is the bytecode that is executed for instantiating a smart contract on the EVM. 
	• Think of it like executing a constructor of a smart contract to create an object.

### WebDeploy Script:
	• this as two items; 
	• json script to web application to invoke smart contract function, 
	• script for programmatically deploying a smart contract from a web application. 

### Gas estimates:
	• provides a gas estimates for deploying the smart contract and for the function invocation.

### Function hashes:
	• hashes, first four byte of the function signatures to facilitate function invocation by a transaction.

### Instance Bytecode:
	• actual run-time bytecode of the smart contract
