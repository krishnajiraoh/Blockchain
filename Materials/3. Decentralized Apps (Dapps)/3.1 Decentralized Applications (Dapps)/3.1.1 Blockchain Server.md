## Blockchain Server:

- Decentralized applications or DApps, open up the features and services of the blockchain to the whole world for review, interaction, and enjoyment.
- DApp gives access to people, applications and systems, not necessarily known to each other to transact peer to peer. 
- DApp is an end to end application on a blockchain.

### Dapp:
- A DApp or a decentralized application depends on the functionality of a blockchain for its infrastructure and operations.
- In its simplest form, a DApp has a client interface as a front-end, and a back-end that includes a blockchain and a smart contract.
	- The client or the front-end can be a web app, HTML and JavaScript framework. A command line interface, CLI, a desktop application, a mobile application, or even an IoT, Internet of Things.
	- Understand web front-end is outside the blockchain protocol, and it can only link into the blockchain smart contract, 
	using artifacts generated by the smart contract compile process
- Additionally, a DApp can be created with a non-blockchain back-end. Interplanetary file system, IPFS, is an example of such an architecture. Ex: Tor, BitTorrent

- It has a peer-to-peer network on which that blockchain operates. 
- The node of a blockchain hosts the EVM and the smart contract runs on the EVM. 
- The user interfaces of the Dapp runs on top of this layer, they use the smart contract for their logic.

- We're going to coin the term blockchain server for representing the infrastructure and the functionality the blockchain provides.
- This nomenclature is drawn from the similarity in a web server- web apps, Mobile server- mobile client apps, database server- database clients, etc. 
- So the term, blockchain server for all the functionality it provides, Blockchain server Dapps


## ENS:
## What is and how to use the Ethereum Name Service (ENS)
- The ENS is an Ethereum-based dapp built on smart contracts. 
- It allows users to register a unique domain name for their wallet address, allowing the transfer of funds to be made directly to a name instead of an address (currently in development?).
- The ENS will also be used for Swarm and IPFS content hashes, and other identifiers, allowing users to easily browse and access files on these networks while providing metadata about names, such as ABIs for contracts, and whois information for users
