# Decentralized Systems

### Trust:

- In a decentralized system, there is nobody checking your credentials and certifying that you are trustworthy. Then, how do you establish trust?
- You do it by using algorithms and techniques discussed in the last module. 
- Trust in a decentralized blockchain is also about securing, validating, verifying, and making sure resources needed for transaction execution are available. 
- This is accomplished by securing the chain using specific protocols, validating the transaction and blocks for tamper proofing, verifying the availability of resources for transactions, and executing and confirming the transactions. 
- The Trust Trail is defined by these operations:
   - validate transaction, 
   - verify gas and resources, 
   - gather transactions, execute transaction to get a new state, 
   - form the block, 
   - work towards consensus, finalize the block by the bidder, 
   - and everyone add the block to their chain and confirm the transactions.
