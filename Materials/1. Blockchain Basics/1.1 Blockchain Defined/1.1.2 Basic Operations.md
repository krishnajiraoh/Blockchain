# Basic Operations

## List of operations:

	• validation of transactions, 
	• gathering the transactions for a block, 
	• broadcasting the valid transactions & blocks, 
	• consensus on the next block creation, 
	• chaining the blocks to form an immutable record.



## Two types of Participants:

	• Participants that initiate transfer of value by creating a transaction, 
	• additional participants called miners, who pick on added work or computation to verify transactions, broadcast transaction, compete to claim the right to create a block, work on reaching consensus by validating the block, broadcasting the newly created block, and confirming transactions. 


## Miners:

	The miners are incentivised with bitcoins for the efforts in managing the blockchain, 
	Transaction validation is carried out independently by all miners. 
	The process involves validation of more than 20 criteria, including size, syntax, et cetera. 
	Some of these criteria are: Referenced Input Unspent Transaction Output, UTXOs are valid, reference output UTXOs are correct, reference input amount and output amount matched sufficiently, invalid transactions are rejected and will not be broadcast. 
	All the valid transactions are added to a pool of transactions. 
	Miners select a set of transaction from this pool to create a block. 

## PoW:

	Miners compete to solving a puzzle to determine who earn the right to create the next block. 
	In the case of bitcoin blockchain, this puzzle is a computational puzzle and the central processing unit or CPU intensive. 
	Once a miner solves the puzzle, the announcement is broadcast to the network and the block is also broadcast to the network. 
	Then, other participant verify the new block. 
	Participants reach a consensus to add a new block to the chain. 
	This new block is added to their local copy of the blockchain. 
	Thus, a new set of transactions are recorded and confirmed. 
	The algorithm for consensus is called proof-of -work protocol, since it involves work a computational power to solve the puzzle and to claim the right to form the next block. 

## Block Reward:

	Transaction zero, index zero of the confirmed block is created by the miner of the block. 
	It has a special UTXO and does not have any input UTXO. 
	It is called the coinbase transaction that generates a minor's fees for the block creation. 
	Currently, the minor's fees is 12.5 BTC for a bitcoin.
