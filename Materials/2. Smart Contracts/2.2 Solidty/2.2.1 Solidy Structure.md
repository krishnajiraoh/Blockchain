### Solidity:
	- Solidity is a high level language that is a combination of JavaScript,  Java, and C++. 
	- It is specially designed to write smart contracts and to target the Ethereum Virtual Machine.

### Supported Environment:
	- Remix supports free runtime test environments, JavaScript VM, Injected Web3, like Metamask, and Web3 Provider, for example, your locally running Ethereum node.


## Structure:


	- Data or state variables, functions, 
	- Functions:
		○ Constructor, default or user-specified
			§ only one, meaning it cannot be overloaded. 
		○ Fallback function
			§ there's a powerful feature of an anonymous function
		○ View functions
		○ pure functions
			§ no state change, 
			§ it computes under terms of value, example math functions. 
		○ Public functions
			§  accessible from outside, 
			§ through transactions, state changes recorded on the blockchain. 
		○ Private function
			§ accessible only with the current contract.
		○ Internal function
			§ accessible inside the current contract and inherited contracts. 
		○ External functions
			§ can be accessed only from outside the smart contract. 
	- User defined types in struct and enums. 
	- Modifiers and, finally, events.

	- Besides its explicit content, a smart contract can also inherit from other smart contract
