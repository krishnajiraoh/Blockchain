- The proof of work puzzle winner, miner that creates a new block, is incentivized with the base fees of three Ethers, and the transaction fees in Ethereum blockchain.
- The winning miner also gets the fees, gas points for execution of a smart contract transactions.

## Ommers:
  - there may be other miners who also solve the puzzle besides the winner.
  - These miners will solve the puzzle, but didn't win the block are called Ommers. 
  - The blocks created by them are called Ommer Blocks. 
  - These are added as Ommer Blocks, or side blocks, to the main chain.
  - Ommer miners also get a small percentage of the total gas points as a consolation and for network security
