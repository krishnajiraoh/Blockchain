### Solidity:
- Solidity is a high level language that is a combination of JavaScript,  Java, and C++. 
- It is specially designed to write smart contracts and to target the Ethereum Virtual Machine.

### Supported Environment:
- Remix supports free runtime test environments, JavaScript VM, Injected Web3, like Metamask, and Web3 Provider, for example, your locally running Ethereum node.

- Data or state variables, functions, 
- Functions:
	- Constructor, default or user-specified
		- only one, meaning it cannot be overloaded. 
	- Fallback function
		- there's a powerful feature of an anonymous function
	- View functions
	- pure functions
		- no state change, 
		- it computes under terms of value, example math functions. 
	- Public functions
		-  accessible from outside, 
		- through transactions, state changes recorded on the blockchain. 
	- Private function
		- accessible only with the current contract.
	- Internal function
		- accessible inside the current contract and inherited contracts. 
	- External functions
		- can be accessed only from outside the smart contract. 
- User defined types in struct and enums. 
- Modifiers and, finally, events.
- Besides its explicit content, a smart contract can also inherit from other smart contract
