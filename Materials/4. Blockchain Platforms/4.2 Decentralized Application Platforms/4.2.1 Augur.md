# Augur

### Prediction Markets:
- The central idea of these markets is that you bet an outcome of an event. 
- Though these are in existence for a long time, most of these prediction markets are centralized. 
- There has always been a ledger, but traditionally, it has been localized to an organization. 
- Decentralization with an immutable distributed ledger of the blockchain throws open the prediction markets to enormous opportunities
- Augur leverages the trust decentralization of the blockchain and opens up the prediction markets to the wisdom of the crowds


### Augur:
- Augur is a trustless, decentralized prediction market platform based on blockchain technology. 
- Participants can join and leave as they wish. That's why it is trustless. 
- It is decentralized since its underlying technology is based on the decentralization feature of the blockchain. 
- The participants are not bound by any central authority

### Ideas:
- End-to-end Prediction Market
- Augur facilitates an end-to-end process from creation to settlement of a prediction on anything, from an idea of project, proposal, stock, stock futures, pouts and experiment in others. 
- This is set up by a smart contract. 
- Trading platform:
	- To give just a few examples, Augur allows decentralized global trading on any idea, a proposal and event outcome or the effect of a policy. 
	- Trading patterns can be used to forecast outcomes. 
	- Since all of these are decentralized, anybody anywhere can participate. 
- Reputation system:
	- Augur provides a platform for decentralized participants to speculate on an event outcome based on their belief
- Crowd reporting:
	- Augur features an incentivized model for materializing the wisdom of the crowd using its own token rep or reputation token. 
- Oracle
	- Augur captures the wisdom of the crowd in a secure Oracle that could be accessed by the underlying smart contracts for resolving the outcomes

### Roles:
- Market creator 
	- who places the market event and sets the expected outcomes, pays fees and escrows, and establishes the rules, and designates the initial set of reporters. 
- A trader
	- who places the bets on the expected outcomes and takes part in the pre-reporting phase of the process.
	- Traders buy and trade shares that bet on the odds of the outcomes.  
	- The trading currency is currently Ether, that of Ethereum blockchain.
- A reporter,
	- who reports on the outcomes. 
	- Understand that outcomes do not have to be binary, as we all know.
	- The reporter can be a designated reporter, or an open reporter, based on the phase of the process.

#### Outcomes may not be binary. 
- It can be scalar with many possible outcomes.
- the market event is how many drugs will be approved by FDA in 2018?
	○ Range of outcomes is between 0 and 30. 
- will SpaceX land on Mars the end of 2018? 
	○ Outcome here is binary, YES or NO.

## Process:

- A stakeholder creates a marketplace.
- This results in configuration and deployment of smart contracts on the Ethereum network. 
- Rep tokens are used in this process and Ether for smart contract executions.
- Trading begins as soon as a prediction event is posted.
- The designated reporting period begins. 
- After the designated reporting period, a tenative outcome prediction may be available. 
- If not, the first prediction after this is assumed to be the predicted outcome.
- It can be disputed by the reporters by staking rep tokens. 
###
- In the worst case, the dispute phase may result in a fork. 
- Augur protocol has robust methods to address forks and the disputes.
- Next, the prediction phase ends with a prediction.
- The event happens. 
- The next phase of reporting begins. 
- At the end of the reporting period,  the collective reported outcome is a availble as an oracle.
- It is accessed by the smart contract to finalize the outcome and settle the trades and fees.
###
- A user can create a market,  post market events, trade, and/or report. 
- The trading token is Ether, and the reporting token is rep.
